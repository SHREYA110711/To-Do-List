# To-Do-List

Project Description:
This project is a web application that allows users to create and manage their to-do lists. It is built using Node.js and Express.js as the server-side framework, and MongoDB as the database. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to separate the concerns of data, presentation, and control logic.

Features:

The home page displays the user's to-do list, including default items and any user-added items.

Users can add new items to their to-do list by entering a task in the input field and clicking the "+" button.

Users can mark completed tasks by checking the checkbox next to the item, and it will be removed from the list.

Users can create new lists and switch between different lists using the navigation bar.

The application is responsive and works on all devices.


Technologies used:

Node.js as the server-side runtime environment

Express.js as the server-side framework

MongoDB as the database

Mongoose.js as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as the template engine for server-side rendering

CSS for styling the application
